      <p>Airsoft is like paintball but we use BB’s instead and play a variety of games from capture the flag to infected, Jacket  and NightOps where you play from Saturday 11am till the next morning 6am. Where you can go out on missions with your buddies and have some fun.<br>
        <br>
        In South Africa we have a good community of airsoft players where all are welcome from the youngest being 8 that I’ve seen to older gentleman that enjoy the tactics and close-knit community
